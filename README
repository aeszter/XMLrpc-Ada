According to ESR, "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
personal itch."

The converse is probably not true, but here goes...
One day, I needed to integrate Bugzilla into a project of mine.
Bugzilla does XML-RPC (http://xml-rpc.com) and JSON-RPC, but not SOAP. 
There does not seem to be an implementation of XML-RPC available in
Ada, but AWS (http://www.adacore.com/aws) supports SOAP, which can be
called a successor to XML-RPC. In fact, SOAP is very similar to a
superset of XML-RPC, so I've decided to enlist the help of AWS to
implement XML-RPC.
For now, the client's side is all I care about.
